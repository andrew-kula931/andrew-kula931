## About Me
I'm currently a software engineering student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 
- I enjoy learning new computational concepts and algorithms and then implementing them into something applicable and fun.
- I work primarily in Web Dev but find other areas of Computer Science fascinating to learn more about and work with.

- I also enjoy hitting the gym every now and then (can't code all day)

I'm currently an intern at 2mation Solutions where I work with a small team to build full-stack applications for client businesses. I work in both frontend UI/UX and backend management and organization. 

I work mostly in Dart and JavaScript but Python falls within the mix a healthy amount. 
> I hope to one day master Whitespace.
