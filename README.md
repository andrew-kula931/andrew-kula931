## About Me
I'm currently a software engineering student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 
- I enjoy learning new computational concepts and algorithms and then implementing them into something applicable and fun.
- I work primarily in Web Dev but find other areas of Computer Science fascinating to learn more about and work with.

- I also enjoy hitting the gym every now and then (can't code all day)

### Experience
I'm currently a junior software developer at 2mation Solutions where I work with a small team to build full-stack applications for client businesses. I work in both frontend UI/UX and backend management and organization. I've developed applications from the first line of code to the full release and regular maintaince beyond that. I've seen and solved a variety of real world issues such as network optimizations, efficient adaptation to sudden requirement specification changes, and creation of inuitive UIs that the client finds enjoyable and easy to use.

I work mostly in Dart and JavaScript but Python falls within the mix a healthy amount. 

### Personal Projects
Here are two links to personal projects I've made, both of which are still in development.

Buchritter (Book Knight) - https://buchritter.onrender.com

WorkingItOut (Organizational App with a few games) - https://feigling.tail417b54.ts.net/workingitout

**Note**: Buchritter is hosted in reserved server space that winds down when given no activity. WorkingItOut is hosted on my own personal server so response times should be faster but can't handle a large traffic size.
